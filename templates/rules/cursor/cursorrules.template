# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Cursor Rules

## About This Project
<!-- Describe your project so Cursor understands the context. -->
[Describe your project here]

## Tech Stack
- Language: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]
- Framework: [e.g., React, FastAPI, Express]
- Build tool: [e.g., Vite, Webpack, esbuild]
- Package manager: [e.g., npm, pnpm, poetry]

## Code Style & Conventions
<!-- Define the coding style Cursor should follow when generating code. -->
- [e.g., "Use functional components with hooks, never class components"]
- [e.g., "Prefer const over let; never use var"]
- [e.g., "Use async/await instead of .then() chains"]

## Skills & Best Practices
<!-- VibeLint will replace this placeholder with skill content from your analysis. -->
{{SKILL_REFS}}

## Project Structure
<!-- Help Cursor understand where things live in the codebase. -->
- `src/` — [Main application source code]
- `src/components/` — [Reusable UI components]
- `tests/` — [Test files mirroring src structure]
- [Add other directories relevant to your project]

## Naming Conventions
- Files: [e.g., "kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components"]
- Variables: [e.g., "camelCase for variables and functions"]
- Constants: [e.g., "UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants"]

## Patterns to Follow
- [e.g., "Use the repository pattern for data access"]
- [e.g., "Wrap all async operations in try/catch"]

## Patterns to Avoid
- [e.g., "Do not use any/unknown types without justification"]
- [e.g., "Do not mutate state directly"]

## Testing
- [e.g., "Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library"]
- [e.g., "Use describe/it blocks with descriptive test names"]

## Error Handling
- [e.g., "Use custom error classes for domain errors"]
- [e.g., "Always provide meaningful error messages"]

## Additional Context
<!-- Any other rules or context Cursor should know about. -->
- [e.g., "API responses follow the JSON:API specification"]
- [e.g., "All dates are stored and transmitted in UTC"]
