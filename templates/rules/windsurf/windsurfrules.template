# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Windsurf Rules

## Project Description
<!-- Provide a concise description so Windsurf understands the project context. -->
[Describe your project here]

## Technology Stack
- Language: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]
- Framework: [e.g., React, FastAPI, Express]
- Build system: [e.g., Vite, Webpack, esbuild]
- Package manager: [e.g., npm, pnpm, poetry]

## Skills & Best Practices
<!-- VibeLint will replace this placeholder with skill content from your analysis. -->
{{SKILL_REFS}}

## Code Generation Rules
<!-- Define rules Windsurf must follow when generating or modifying code. -->
- [e.g., "Always add type annotations to function parameters and return values"]
- [e.g., "Use early returns to reduce nesting depth"]
- [e.g., "Keep functions under 30 lines where possible"]

## Architecture Guidelines
- [e.g., "Follow clean architecture with separate domain, application, and infrastructure layers"]
- [e.g., "Use the adapter pattern for external service integrations"]

## Directory Layout
- `src/` — [Main source code]
- `src/domain/` — [Domain models and business logic]
- `src/services/` — [Application services]
- `tests/` — [Test files]
- [Add other directories]

## Formatting & Style
- [e.g., "Use 2-space indentation"]
- [e.g., "Maximum line length: 100 characters"]
- [e.g., "Sort imports: built-in, external, internal"]

## Error Handling
- [e.g., "Use typed error classes with error codes"]
- [e.g., "Never catch errors without logging or re-throwing"]

## Testing Standards
- [e.g., "Write tests for all public functions"]
- [e.g., "Use AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert"]
- [e.g., "Aim for 80% code coverage on new code"]

## Things to Avoid
- [e.g., "Never use eval() or dynamic code execution"]
- [e.g., "Do not hardcode configuration values"]
- [e.g., "Do not commit secrets or credentials"]

## Additional Notes
- [e.g., "This project deploys to AWS Lambda"]
- [e.g., "All API responses are paginated by default"]
