# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Agent Instructions

## Overview
<!-- Provide a clear description of the project for any AI coding agent. -->
[Describe your project here]

## Technology Stack
- Language: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]
- Framework: [e.g., React, FastAPI, Express]
- Build tool: [e.g., Vite, Webpack, esbuild]
- Package manager: [e.g., npm, pnpm, poetry]

## Skills & Best Practices
<!-- VibeLint will replace this placeholder with skill content from your analysis. -->
{{SKILL_REFS}}

## Coding Standards
- [e.g., "Use strict type checking; avoid 'any' types"]
- [e.g., "Functions should do one thing and do it well"]
- [e.g., "Keep files focused; one component or module per file"]
- [e.g., "Use meaningful names that reveal intent"]

## Project Structure
<!-- Document the directory layout so the agent can navigate the codebase. -->
- `src/` — [Main application source code]
- `src/core/` — [Core business logic]
- `src/api/` — [API layer: routes, controllers, middleware]
- `tests/` — [Test suites]
- [Add other important directories]

## Development Workflow
- Build: `[your build command]`
- Test: `[your test command]`
- Lint: `[your lint command]`
- Dev server: `[your dev server command]`

## Architecture Principles
- [e.g., "Separate concerns into distinct layers"]
- [e.g., "Use interfaces to define contracts between modules"]
- [e.g., "Prefer composition over inheritance"]

## Error Handling
- [e.g., "Use typed error hierarchies"]
- [e.g., "Log errors at the boundary, not in utility functions"]

## Testing Expectations
- [e.g., "Unit tests for all business logic"]
- [e.g., "Integration tests for API endpoints"]
- [e.g., "Tests must pass before any code is merged"]

## Things to Avoid
- [e.g., "No circular dependencies between modules"]
- [e.g., "No magic numbers; use named constants"]
- [e.g., "No console.log in production code; use the logger"]

## Platform-Specific Notes
- This file is designed to work with any AI coding agent.
- Adapt the instructions to your platform's conventions as needed.
